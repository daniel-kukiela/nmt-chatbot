The fire escape is there. You hear wood splintering, and look to see that a raptor has managed to break a hole in the top of the door, just above the dresser. Its head pokes through, then disappears. There's another thud, and the dresser moves forward a few inches.

This case has been a months long commercial for IP, which thrives on donations.  They will delay this as long as possible
Oh. Can we be friends again?

I physically cringed at 'creamy thighs.'
I need new Japanese music to listen to recommend me something. Also today I saw some real life zettai ryouiki it was great. 
Evidence is racist!
It's kind of hilarious because all of the racist submissions get taken down in like four seconds, but they keep trying anyway. Silly racists.

Maybe you're right.  Didn't mean to come off with hostility.
[](/rocklobster) what would you like in return?
All animals. Except mosquitos. Those fuckers only know hate.

Hey Al, I found a link error.

Welp, those bastards over at /r/AustinGuns have almost burned through 200 rounds of M2 ball in a month. Bring more if you come out. Still waiting on my next CMP delivery. 
Same feel when we are playing against outfits on Jaeger.

[](/happyflutterbat)Well, I'm still changing sometimes. newlinechar  newlinechar But I haven't been acting like an animal. 
I get what you're saying, though. It's going to be great to get to a point in the culture where we can just say 'Oh, you like dudes? Cool.' :) We'll get there eventually.
Thank God.  We should be grateful.
Oh for sure. I can definitely see CZW doing that.. and then someone being impaled in one of the bamboo.. things.. or whatever the hell they were, what were they? Jesus

I was halfway through 3E435 when I finally finished.
I don't know what that is but anything with 'monoxide' in its title sounds like something I do not want to be drinking.
Dan Boyle is Jagr, have you ever seen them in the same room together?

Why do you feel that way about the cape?
I am not sure which AD SK could get to get to these 4 teams. Except they get some korean or chinese import.
