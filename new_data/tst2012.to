Thank you.  I think it would garner a lot of support from people tired of these niggers acting like this. 
Ton of people every game thread I've been in. Calling him overhyped and trash, even though the kid can't legally drink yet.

They play it on a station called Sprout, basically a poor man's nick jr. Suddenlink dropped Nickelodeon from our lineup a year ago so it's the kid's only option
Yeah, I did wonder about that but I couldn't bring myself to think Deirdre would be that mercenary!  I mean it's one thing not bowing out but she's actually spoken publicly about it arguing his innocence.  Her reputation is on the line surely?
Okay cool.

It is. Just like logical thought is a creation of The Patriarchy.
I  know I keep reporting them but they keep coming back!

I get what you're saying, though. It's going to be great to get to a point in the culture where we can just say 'Oh, you like dudes? Cool.' :) We'll get there eventually.

[](/seriouslyupset-r) There is nothing wrong with changing. In fact, I hope you continue to do so. As long as you remember that you are a pony.
Maybe we get there by criticizing the inappropriate reactions.  :P
I am. And apparently [Bradford was included](https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/593928657158033408). What the actual fuck.

Ah. Thanks. Fuck Mayo. Haha.
I did that. The comment is deleted
Two of them are definitely beaters!  LOL!
